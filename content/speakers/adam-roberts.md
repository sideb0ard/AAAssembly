**Exploring the Creative Potential of Deep Learning through the Magenta Project**

Over the past 3 years, the increase in the generative power of deep neural networks has been staggering. [WaveNets](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/)Â can produce speech nearly indistinguishable from humans, [GANs generate images](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) of imagined faces in great detail, and [Music Transformers](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-transformer) can play piano like a virtuoso. In this talk we will examine the recent progress in deep learning-based generative models and see how this new technology can be used as a tool to enhance, not replace human creativity. We will mostly focus on the work of the [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) project of the [Google Brain Team](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain), but we will also see examples of other work in this space.

Adam Roberts earned his PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley with a designated emphasis in Computational and Genomic Biology. He has since focused on combining music and technology at Google, where he helped to organize the world's music knowledge for Google Play and is now applying deep learning to the generation of music and art for Google Brain team's <a href="https://g.co/magenta" target="_blank">Magenta</a> project.
