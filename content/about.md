<div class="about-child">
<p>
<span class="bold">Algorithmic Art Assembly</span> is a brand new two day conference and music festival, showcasing a diverse range of artists who are using algorithmic tools and processes in their works. From live coding visuals and music at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h340aNznHnM" target="_blank">algoraves</a>, to virtual reality, gaming, augmented tooling, generative music composition, or knot tying, this event celebrates artists abusing algorithms for the aesthetics.
</p>

<p>
Daytime talks will present speakers introducing and demonstrating their art, in an informal and relaxed setting, (very much inspired by <a href="http://dorkbotsf.org" target="_blank">Dorkbot</a>).
</p>

<p>
Each day will feature one workshop in an intimate setting, creating an opportunity for you to learn how to create live coded music using two of the main platforms, SuperCollider and TidalCycles. Workshops are limited in space, with reservation required - details to come.
</p>

<p>
Evening performances will be heavily based upon the <a href="https://github.com/Algorave/guidelines/blob/master/README_en.md" target="_blank">algorave</a> format, in which the dancefloor is accompanied by a look behind the veil, with several artists projecting a livestream of their code on screen. Performers will play energetic sets back to back, with minimal switch-over time.

Organized by myself, <a href="http://theb0ardside.com/" target="_blank">Thorsten Sideb0ard</a>, the event is very much inspired by a 2018 trip to Sheffield, United Kingdom, where I participated in a <a href="http://livecode.toplap.org/2018/" target="_blank">Livecode festival</a>, including an incredible two room algorave. The DIY sensibilities, the music, visuals, the thriving international community around live coding, which I experienced, were so energizing, I was compelled to give back to my home community in San Francisco. The festival will take place at <a href="https://grayarea.org" target="_blank">Gray Area</a> Foundation for the Arts, an organization that embodies these creative values and delivers culture through art and tech.
