        <p>A beginners' live coding workshop presented by SONA, for women and non-binary people. The workshop will be lead by Shelly Knotts and Joanne Armitage (<a href="/performers/algobabez/">Algobabez</a>).</p>
        <p>Learn the basics of setting up a live coding session and making soundscapes and beats with sound synthesis and patterns in SuperCollider.</p>
        <p><a href="http://supercollider.github.io/" target="_blank" class="bold">SuperCollider</a> is an incredibly powerful, open-source, cross-platform, audio engine and programming language, used not only to create music, but also for machine listening, audio/music reactive installations, performance, interactive systems, research, live-coding and much more.</p>
        <p>You will need your own computer (OSX / Windows/ Linux), and a pair of headphones.</p>

        <h3 class="bold">An Introduction to TidalCycles</h3>
        <p>In this workshop, led by Mike Hodnick (<a href="/performers/kindohm/">Kindohm</a>), you will learn how to use the TidalCycles live-coding tools to create sound patterns.</p>
        <p><a href="https://tidalcycles.org" target="_blank" class="bold">TidalCycles</a> is free/open source software, that allows you to make patterns with code, whether live coding music at algoraves or composing in the studio.</a>
        <p>The session will cover features such as the core TidalCycle pattern syntax, pattern transformation, time shifting/alteration, algorithmic composition, randomness, and audio/DSP control.</p>
        <p>Please come prepared with your own laptop and with TidalCycles and SuperDirt already installed. Installation help will be available before the workshop, details TBD.</p>
