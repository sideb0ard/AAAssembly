Kindohm is Mike Hodnick, a programmer and sound artist from Chaska, Minnesota, USA. He has performed his brand of coded, algorithmic electronic music internationally, appearing at Algoraves and the International Conference on Live Coding in 2015 and 2016. In 2014, he received the Minnesota Emerging Composer Award from the American Composers Forum. Hodnick sequences sharp synthesis and drums with stacks of TidalCycles pattern code, resulting in bruisingly complex and alluringly minimal live arrangements.
