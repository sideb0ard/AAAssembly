W00dy from Pittsburgh is attempting to bring absurdity to the dance floor with fast bpm's, high energy polyrhythms, and wacky samples. She sees the dance floor as a place for healing, and therefore writes music inspired by moments of catharsis. With two experimental pop records under her belt, RNBW (2015, self released) and Timberdoodle (2016, Fire Talk Records), she moved in a drastically different direction last year with her first dance music record, this world has rendered me (2017, self released). W00dy's second full-length dance music record, Relentless Kickdrum, was self-released September 2018.
