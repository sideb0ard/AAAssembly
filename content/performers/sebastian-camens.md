Sebastian Camens is a Dutch/Australian artist and designer based in Seattle. His sound leans into an oxymoronic minimal maximalism, utilising stochastic processes to construct brutal patterns of sound, inflating into the entire frequency range. Camensâ€™ work often transforms sound into near-tangible objects, with implied physical properties of weight and texture.
