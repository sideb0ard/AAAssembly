Based on observations of disparate corners of world-phenomena like leaf venation to discarded car parts, Shatter Pattern performs the sonic use and misuse of pattern, the formation of and deformation of ordered structures. By creating rhythmic intricacies and then unexpectedly breaking them down into dysfunctional minutia, Shatter Pattern sonically and visually extrudes worlds from signal interferences that interlope with your perception of reality and being, to reuse the shards of fragmented particles of sound as a vaporous reminder of the primacy of earth's grounding power. Shatter Pattern is the more human-facing "dance" project of bay area electronic musician Waxy Tomb, who has performed at The Lab, SFEMF, Artists Television Access, CCRMA and more.
