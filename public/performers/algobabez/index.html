        <p>ALGOBABEZ have been blasting eardrums with noisy synth-driven algo-pop since 2016. Formed of algorave regulars Shelly Knotts and Joanne Armitage, they use SuperCollider to code and control patterns of weird, wonky, noisy, thumping, danceable music. OK apart, but better together: 2 babes, 2 laptops and 1 sound.</p>
<p>Shelly Knotts is a data musician currently based in Newcastle, UK. She performs live-coded and network music internationally, collaborating with computers and other humans. She is studying for a PhD in Live Computer Music at Durham University with a focus on collaboration in Network Music.
