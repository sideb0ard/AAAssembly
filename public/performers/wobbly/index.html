        <p>WOBBLY / Jon Leidecker has been producing music under the name Wobbly since 1990, improvising with recordings to produce music which inherently resists the act of being captured. Recent performances deploy a battery of mobile devices driven by their built-in microphones, reacting instantly with error-prone variations on the notes and sounds they believe they are hearing: a tightly-knit orchestra with inhuman reflexes, resulting in structures which the human performer influences more than controls. Your phone is the instrument, and your phone is always listening. Wobbly&rsquo;s live and studio collaborations include work with Negativland, Dieter Moebius &amp; Tim Story, Matmos, People Like Us, Fred Frith, Zeena Parkins, Carl Stone, John Oswald, Thomas Dimuzio, The Freddy McGuire Show and Sagan. In 2015 he inherited Negativland&rsquo;s long-running Over The Edge radio collage program, which continues to be broadcast twice a month on Berkeley&rsquo;s KPFA FM.</p>
