      <description>ALGOBABEZ have been blasting eardrums with noisy synth-driven algo-pop since 2016. Formed of algorave regulars Shelly Knotts and Joanne Armitage, they use SuperCollider to code and control patterns of weird, wonky, noisy, thumping, danceable music. OK apart, but better together: 2 babes, 2 laptops and 1 sound.
Shelly Knotts is a data musician currently based in Newcastle, UK. She performs live-coded and network music internationally, collaborating with computers and other humans.</description>

      <description>Mark Fell is a Rotherham based electronic musician, multidisciplinary artist and producer whose work has persistently challenged the boundaries between dance music and academic computer music practices. Having studied experimental film and video at Sheffield’s notorious Psalter Lane art school at the onset of the city’s techno era (circa 1990), Fell’s approach is equally grounded in the theory and practice of experimental film, radical philosophy and the electronic music subcultures surrounding house and techno.</description>

      <description>William Fields (b.1977) is an artist, musician, and composer from the greater Philadelphia area whose work explores algorithmic composition and audio-visual correspondence in the context of real-time improvisational live performance. His music has been released on labels such as Conditional, New York Haunted, Audiobulb, and NOREMIXES. He has performed live throughout the mid-Atlantic region and Canada. His work was selected and choreographed for dance as part of the International Computer Music Conference (ICMC).</description>

      <description>Gleaning inspiration from disparate corners of world-phenomena like leaf venation to discarded car parts, Shatter Pattern performs the sonic use and misuse of pattern, the formation of and deformation of ordered structures. By creating rhythmic intricacies and then unexpectedly breaking them down into dysfunctional minutia, Shatter Pattern performances extrude worlds from signal interferences that interlope with your perception of reality and being, to reuse the shards of fragmented particles of sound as a vaporous reminder of the primacy of earth&amp;rsquo;s grounding power.</description>

      <description>W00dy from Pittsburgh is attempting to bring absurdity to the dance floor with fast bpm&amp;rsquo;s, high energy polyrhythms, and wacky samples. She sees the dance floor as a place for healing, and therefore writes music inspired by moments of catharsis. With two experimental pop records under her belt, RNBW (2015, self released) and Timberdoodle (2016, Fire Talk Records), she moved in a drastically different direction last year with her first dance music record, this world has rendered me (2017, self released).</description>

      <description>Kindohm is Mike Hodnick, a programmer and sound artist from Chaska, Minnesota, USA. He has performed his brand of coded, algorithmic electronic music internationally, appearing at Algoraves and the International Conference on Live Coding in 2015 and 2016. Hodnick sequences sharp synthesis and drums with stacks of TidalCycles pattern code, resulting in bruisingly complex and alluringly minimal live arrangements. In 2014, Hodnick received the Minnesota Emerging Composer Award from the American Composers Forum.</description>

      <description>Sebastian Camens is a Dutch/Australian artist and designer based in Seattle. His sound leans into an oxymoronic minimal maximalism, utilising stochastic processes to construct brutal patterns of sound, inflating into the entire frequency range. Camens’ work often transforms sound into near-tangible objects, with implied physical properties of weight and texture.</description>

      <guid>https://aaassembly.org/performers/wobbly/</guid>
      <description>WOBBLY / Jon Leidecker has been producing music under the name Wobbly since 1990, improvising with recordings to produce music which inherently resists the act of being captured. Recent performances deploy a battery of mobile devices driven by their built-in microphones, reacting instantly with error-prone variations on the notes and sounds they believe they are hearing: a tightly-knit orchestra with inhuman reflexes, resulting in structures which the human performer influences more than controls.</description>

      <description>Spatial is an electronic musician and multimedia artist from London whose work pushes the dynamics of sound system culture incorporating low frequency vibration, hacked code, and optisonic experiments. An unconventional artist in the turbulent realm of bass music, Spatial combines a preoccupation with emergent behaviour, rule based repetition and chaotic systems with an ability to shape dubbed out, cracked and reductive sonics into audible geometric form. Through textured intricate production, Spatial’s releases and live sets bring corporeal presence carved out with a minimalist’s scalpel.</description>
