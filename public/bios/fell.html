            <h1>Mark Fell, Rian Treanor and James Bradbury</h1>
            <p>
            Mark Fell is a Rotherham-based electronic musician, multidisciplinary artist and producer whose work has persistently challenged the boundaries between dance music and academic computer music practices. His new book ‘Structure and Synthesis: The Anatomy of Practice’ will be released in March 2022.<br><br>

            Rian Treanor reimagines the intersection of club culture, experimental art and computer music, presenting an insightful and compelling musical world of fractured and interlocking components.<br><br>

            During the pandemic lockdown, Mark and Rian built a working prototype Max/MSP patch for remote collaboration. After wrestling with the intricacies of having remote parties install and configure connections, they found a new solution: Working with James Bradbury, a creative coder from Perth, Australia, they built a web audio based collaborative synth engine, which greatly simplified the barrier to play.<br><br>

            Their first collaboration was <a href="https://intersymmetric.xyz/seq-1/idx">https://intersymmetric.xyz/seq-1/idx</a> which was commissioned by the No Bounds festival.<br>

            For Algorithmic Art Assembly, they will create a second iteration, built upon their framework.
            We’ll conduct a live video interview with them, hosted in San Francisco by Marc Weidenbaum, discussing this project, the thinking and technologies behind it, the larger questions of role of audience in performance, and how our views have changed as the pandemic has increased our adoption of online performances.
