      <description>Windy Chien makes art that activates space and elevates the vernacular. She is best known for her 2016 work, The Year of Knots, in which she learned a new knot every day for a year. Her work ranges in size from a knot that can fit in the palm of a child&amp;rsquo;s hand to majestic, room-sized installations that are sought after by private collectors. Following long careers at Apple and in the music industry, she launched her studio in 2015.</description>

      <description>Gleaning inspiration from disparate corners of world-phenomena like leaf venation to discarded car parts, Shatter Pattern performs the sonic use and misuse of pattern, the formation of and deformation of ordered structures. By creating rhythmic intricacies and then unexpectedly breaking them down into dysfunctional minutia, Shatter Pattern performances extrude worlds from signal interferences that interlope with your perception of reality and being, to reuse the shards of fragmented particles of sound as a vaporous reminder of the primacy of earth&amp;rsquo;s grounding power.</description>

      <description>Jon Leidecker has been engaged with the medium of electronic music since the mid 1980&amp;rsquo;s, with an emphasis on live performance and collaboration. Early works utilized sonic collage &amp;amp; musical appropriation, growing out of a series of appearances on Negativland&amp;rsquo;s live-mix radio program Over The Edge &amp;ndash; improvising with recorded sounds to produce music which inherently resists the act of being recorded. Recent work investigates the history and musical aesthetics implied by the physics of acoustic and electrical feedback, research into the technology and creative workflow required for immersive sound diffusion (including five years of work as a member of the engineering team for Dolby&amp;rsquo;s 3D sound format Atmos), and the use of mobile devices and their built-in microphones as cybernetic improvising partners.</description>
