        <p><strong>Exploring the Creative Potential of Deep Learning through the Magenta Project</strong></p>
<p>Over the past 3 years, the increase in the generative power of deep neural networks has been staggering. <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/">WaveNets</a>Â can produce speech nearly indistinguishable from humans, <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">GANs generate images</a> of imagined faces in great detail, and <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-transformer">Music Transformers</a> can play piano like a virtuoso. In this talk we will examine the recent progress in deep learning-based generative models and see how this new technology can be used as a tool to enhance, not replace human creativity. We will mostly focus on the work of the <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/">Magenta</a> project of the <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/brain">Google Brain Team</a>, but we will also see examples of other work in this space.</p>

<p>Adam Roberts earned his PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley with a designated emphasis in Computational and Genomic Biology. He has since focused on combining music and technology at Google, where he helped to organize the world&rsquo;s music knowledge for Google Play and is now applying deep learning to the generation of music and art for Google Brain team&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Magenta<!-- raw HTML omitted --> project.</p>
