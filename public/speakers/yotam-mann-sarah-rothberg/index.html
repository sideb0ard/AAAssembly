        <p><strong>Blobchat, a Typed-Talk</strong></p>
<p>Yotam and Sarah communicate about communication, using a text-based musical communication interface. The interface is part of their ongoing project, Blobchat, which combines sound, machine-learning, gesture, and chatrooms as a way to ask: is misunderstanding a part of understanding? How do machines mediate? How else can they?</p>
