        <p><strong>Queering Generativity, Querying Generativity: Generative Algorithms and Postnatural narratives</strong></p>
<p>This talk will focus on Generative algorithms, growth algorithms, Evolutionary and Life simulation in order to ask how algorithmic principles, and their rendered visual outputs, construct and deconstruct narratives about the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; the &ldquo;living&rdquo;&quot; and &ldquo;non-living&rdquo; and the dynamics of gendered social relations.</p>

<p>Jules Litman-Cleper is interested in simulated space and materiality as a new creative substrate, with the potential to generate knowledge about our patterns of interaction with information and environment. Jules both creates pieces and designs experiments to research how simulation and visualization influences our interaction with the material world. They studied Spatial Cognition, and built clay-graphical-interfaces during a Masters in Design &amp; Computation at MIT. Jules works in Sculpture, Spatial Media installation and Performance in the San Francisco Bay Area, where they were born and raised.  They have taught classes on Video and Augmented-Reality &amp; Dance and have exhibited at Krowswork, Aggregate Space, New York Studio School, with performances at The Lab, ATA, CCRMA and more.</p>
